                We usually consider functions for which the sets and are sets of real numbers. The
                set is called the domain of the function. The number is the value of at and is
                read “ of .” The range of is the set of all possible values of as varies throughout
                the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function
                is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the range of
                is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for instance, r is the independent variable
                and A is the dependent variable.

                It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain of
                the function then when enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine
                produces an output according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the
                domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs.
                The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a
                machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function.
                You press the key labeled (or ) and enter the input . If , then is not in the
                domain of this function; that is, is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indicate
                an error. If , then an approximation to will appear in the display. Thus the
                key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function
                defined by .
                Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow
                connects an element of to an element of . The arrow indicates that is associated
                with is associated with , and so on.
                The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If is a function with
                domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs
